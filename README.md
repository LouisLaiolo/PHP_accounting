# PHP Accounting

An heavily simplified accounting tool written in PHP. Another academic project completed within a trimester for my senior year in DUT. This project allows anyone to create an account then manage various simple accounting operations related to a fictional company they're supposed to run. You can manage the list of your customers and suppliers, as well as their respective invoices. At the same time, it is possible to manage your employees and your taxes. The final result allows you to generate a simple balance sheet.

## Getting Started

Import the database dump wherever you need, then edit the logins info within includes/config.php to ensure you can properly connect to your database. You can test everything online or using WAMP/XAMP.
